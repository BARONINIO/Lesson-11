        <h3>Big decisions are often accompanied by a feeling of paralysis. Especially when high-voltage emotions are in play. Messi's return cannot be separated from this sentimental framework. Nostalgia is a powerful weapon and it must be very difficult for Laporta to give up on the possibility of bringing Messi back or projecting himself in that young and full of energy 'Jan' of his first term. It is legitimate but it contradicts the story of reconstruction that the club has been selling in recent years.</h3>
    <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo has found himself at the center of controversy once again, as footage released on social media appears to show the veteran forward making an insulting gesture towards fans during Al-Nassr's 2-0 loss to Al-Hilal on Tuesday night.</h3>
    <h3>Kylian Mbappe is tired of the constant negative atmosphere in Paris. One of the Frenchman's dreams is to win the Champions League, but he understands that it is almost impossible to do this with PSG. The club's management makes the wrong decisions, which finally affect the performance in the European tournament.</h3>
